        <item>Get into the standard pushup position with your hands together directly beneath your chest so that index fingers and thumbs are touching to form a triangle or diamond shape.
        \n\nKeeping your core tight, slowly lower your body to the ground. Make sure to keep your elbows tucked in close by your sides so they make a 45-degree angle with your torso. Without altering your hand placement, pause and push yourself back to the starting position.
        </item>


        <item>To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held in one hand. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Now fully extend the arm with the dumbbell over your head. Tip: The small finger of your hand should be facing the ceiling and the palm of your hand should be facing forward. The dumbbell should be above your head.
\n\nThis will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your upper arm close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearm touch your bicep. Tip: The upper arm should remain stationary and only the forearm should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nGo back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
\n\nSwitch arms and repeat the exercise.</item>


        <item>To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.
\n\nThe resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nGo back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</item>


        <item>Start with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing your torso. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.
\n\nNow, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.
\n\nAfter a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</item>


        <item>To begin, stand up holding a barbell or e-z bar using a pronated grip (palms facing forward) with your hands closer than shoulder width apart from each other. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart.
\n\nNow elevate the barbell above your head until your arms are fully extended. Keep your elbows in. This will be your starting position.
\n\nKeeping your upper arms close to your head and elbows in, perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nGo back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the barbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</item>


        <item>Keep your upper arms perpendicular to the floor, not necessarily perpendicular to your body. This ensures you\'re working against gravity. Your arms should automatically be perpendicular to your body when you\'re on a flat bench, but won\'t necessarily be when you\'re doing the movement on an incline or decline bench.
            \n\nOnly extend your elbows. Avoid allowing your upper arms to move back and forth from their position as you raise and lower the weight. If you move your arms, you put some of the load on your shoulders.
            \n\nLower the weight under control, which means using a weight you can safely handle. Use a very deliberate rep speed on the negative. I assume you know why! (If not, just reference the exercise name again.)
            \n\nAs you power the weight back up, stop just short of full extension so that you\'re unable to rest in the top position, which keeps tension on the muscle throughout the range of motion.
            \n\nUse a spotter when training to failure. A spotter can also assist you with a few additional forced reps, hand you the weight to begin, or grab the weight when you\'re done.
            \n\nKeep your elbows in tight as much as possible and avoid elbow flare to ensure the triceps do the bulk of the work. Allowing your elbows to flare out reduces the triceps\' workload.</item>



        <item>Position your hands shoulder-width apart on a secured bench or stable chair.
\n\nSlide your butt off the front of the bench with your legs extended out in front of you.
\n\nStraighten your arms, keeping a little bend in your elbows to keep tension on your triceps and off your elbow joints.
\n\nSlowly bend your elbows to lower your body toward the floor until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle. Be sure to keep your back close to the bench.
\n\nOnce you reach the bottom of the movement, press down into the bench to straighten your elbows, returning to the starting position. This completes one rep.
\n\nKeep your shoulders down as you lower and raise your body. You can bend your legs to modify this exercise.</item>


        <item>Attach a straight or angled bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.
\n\nStanding upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. This is your starting position.
\n\nUsing the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
\n\nAfter a second hold at the contracted position, bring the bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</item>


        <item>Step 1: Sit down on a dip machine. Choose a weight and grasp the handles firmly.
\n\nStep 2: Keep your elbows close to your body. They should be bent at a 90 degree angle.
\n\nStep 3: Contract your triceps and extend your arms down as you exhale. As you contract the triceps, extend your arms downwards as you exhale. Tip: At the bottom of the movement, focus on keeping a little bend in your arms to keep tension on the triceps muscle.
\n\nStep 4: Move your arms back to the starting position as you inhale.
\n\nStep 5: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</item>
